# Noel Jasik
## Developer from Poland

I have been programming for 5+ years now, and have mostly focused on developing video games and websites. I enjoy participating in game jams and love the thrill of creating something new and exciting.

My main programming languages are C# and Javascript, but I am also familiar with Typescript, PHP, Solidity, Java and C++. I am always eager to learn new technologies and expand my skillset.
